**Information Systems Student | Tech Enthusiast**

# Hi, I'm Lala 👋

I'm a 3rd-year Information Systems student passionate about **data and systems**. I enjoy exploring how data flows, analyzing datasets, and building projects that support **data-driven decision-making**. 

This GitHub contains my academic and learning projects as I grow my skills in **data and systems**.
